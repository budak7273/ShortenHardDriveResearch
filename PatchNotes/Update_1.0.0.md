Initial release. Configure how long it takes to research Hard Drives for alternate recipes!

Default is 3 seconds.
You can make it 0 if you want in the mod config settings from the main menu.
You can also make it longer!

Want to reduce how long it takes for other research to complete? Consider:

- [Nog's Automated Research](https://ficsit.app/mod/NogsResearch/) - Build research infrastructure to auto-submit items and reduce Milestone and MAM Research times.
- [Alternate Recipe Research](https://ficsit.app/mod/AltRecipeResearch) - Directly research the specific alternate you want.
- [No Research Time - CL](https://ficsit.app/mod/NoResearchTime) - Make the wait time after every Milestone/MAM Research 0 seconds.
